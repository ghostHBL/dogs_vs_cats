This project include 2 model to classify the dog and cat:
1. a simple cnn model build by myself
2. make a transfer learning model from vgg-net

The data of dogs and cats with label is too larger that I don't want to submit to my github, you can downloader data from kaggle (https://www.kaggle.com/c/dogs-vs-cats-redux-kernels-edition/data) or microsoft (https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/download/details.aspx?id=54765). 

The vgg net you can get from https://github.com/machrisaa/tensorflow-vgg, and the parameter you can get from https://s3.amazonaws.com/content.udacity-data.com/nd101/vgg16.npy, and put the vgg16.npy to the dir of tensorflow_vgg.

I will push model and tensorflow log to my online disk, please wait.

Enjoy it!
